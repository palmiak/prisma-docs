<TopBlock>
This guide takes you through the steps to set up and deploy an application that uses Prisma to [Kinsta Application Hosting](https://kinsta.com/application-hosting). The application uses Next.js to provide a serverless REST API and Prisma Client to handle fetching, creating, and deleting records from a database.

Kinsta is a developer-centric cloud host / PaaS. It's striving to make it easier for developers to share their web projects with their users. You can integrate a Kinsta project with a GitHub repository to deploy automatically on new commits.

The Next.js app has the following components:

- **Backend**: Next.js API routes that serve a REST API and use Prisma Client to handle database operations on a PostgreSQL database.
- **Frontend**: Next.js page to interact with the API.

This guide focuses on how to use Prisma with Next.js and Kinsta. The starting point is the [Prisma Starter](https://github.com/kinsta/hello-world-prisma), which has REST endpoints configured as [Next.js API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) and a Next.js page that allows you to call the endpoints and display data.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, make sure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- a [GitHub](https://github.com) account
- a hosted PostgreSQL database and a connection string for it, e.g., `postgresql://username:password@your_postgres_db.cloud.com/db_identifier` (you can use [Kinsta Database Hosting](https://kinsta.com/database-hosting/))
- a [Kinsta](https://kinsta.com) account
- Node.js installed

## Prisma workflow

At the core of Prisma is the [Prisma schema](/concepts/components/prisma-schema) â€“ a file where you declaratively define your data model. The Prisma schema is a single source of truth for both Prisma Client and Prisma Migrate.

In this guide, you will create the database schema with [Prisma Migrate](/concepts/components/prisma-migrate). Prisma Migrate takes your changes to the data model in your Prisma schema, generates a SQL migration file with the changes, and applies it to your database.

There are two main workflows for Prisma Migrate:

- You can create and apply migrations during _local_ development with `prisma migrate dev`
- You can apply the migrations to _production_ with `prisma migrate deploy`

For brevity, this guide does not cover how to create migrations with `prisma migrate dev`. Instead, it focuses on the production workflow with `prisma migrate deploy` and uses the Prisma schema and SQL migration included in the example code.

Kinsta uses buildpacks, which means that every time it detects a Node.js application, it will run three commands:
- `npm install` to install all the dependencies
- `npm run build` to execute all the commands before starting the server.
- `npm start` to start the server

Those commands are defined in the `package.json` file.

To learn more about creating migrations with Prisma Migrate, see our [Get Started guide](/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch/relational-databases-typescript-postgres).

## 1. Create the project and deploy it to Kinsta

First, you will deploy the [`hello-world-prisma`](https://github.com/kinsta/hello-world-prisma) example repository to Kinsta. As part of the deployment steps, you will **use the template** to create a new GitHub repository and connect your application to your PostgreSQL database.

### Steps
1. Go to [`hello-world-prisma`](https://github.com/kinsta/hello-world-prisma) example repository and press the **Use this template** button and select **Create a new repository**.

2. Create an account on Kinsta, or if you have one, go directly to [MyKinsta](https://my.kinsta.com).

3. Create a new application based on the repository created from the `hello-world-prisma`. To do so, click the **Add service > Application** and follow the setup wizard.

    If this is your first time using Kinsta, you will be prompted to connect Kinsta with your Git account.
    </Admonition>

4. Now create a new Database by selecting **Add service > Database**. In our example, we use PostgreSQL, so remember to choose Database type to **PostgreSQL**.

5. Only thing left is to connect the Database with the application. To do so, go to Applications, select your Prisma Application, go to settings, and press the **Add Connection**. 

    Select the database from the dropdown, and remember to select the **Add environment variables to access the application** checkbox. This will add the `DB_CONNECTION_URL` environmental variable to your app.

    <Admonition type="info">
    Kinsta Database can work both in internal and external modes. The only downside of using internal is that the build process doesn't have access to the internal database. 

    We are moving the build process into the `npm start` phase as a workaround.

6. Click **Deploy now**. 
    
    Kinsta will now deploy your application and run the server based on the commands in the `package.json` file.

### Result

When the build completes, you should see the following:

![Deployment succeeded](images/600-03-deploy-to-kinsta-success.png)

You have successfully deployed the app to Kinsta. 

To check that the API returns data successfully, click on the URL of the deployed application.

When the page loads, click **Check API status**. If successful, you will see a result similar to the image below.

```code no-copy
{"up":true}
```

## 2. Test your deployed application

You can now test your application. Open your application to interact with the API.

### Steps

1. Click **Load users with profiles**.

   You do not yet have any data in the database, so the application returns an empty array:

   ```code no-copy
   []
   ```

   <Admonition type="info">

   This API call uses Prisma to get all `users` in the database with their related `profiles`. The code is in the `pages/api/users.js` file in the project repository.

   </Admonition>

2. Click **Seed data**.

   <Admonition type="info">

   This API call uses Prisma to delete any existing database records and load the database with test `users`, `profiles`, and `posts`, then returns the created `users`. The code is in the `pages/api/seed.js` file.

   </Admonition>

3. Click **Load users with profiles** again.

   This now returns the `users` and `profiles` that you added in the previous step:

   ```code no-copy
   [
   {
   "id": 5,
   "email": "jane@prisma.io",
   "name": "Jane",
   "profiles": [
     {
       "id": 13,
       "bio": "Technical Writer",
       "userId": 5
     },
     {
       "id": 14,
       "bio": "Health Enthusiast",
       "userId": 5
     },
     {
       "id": 15,
       "bio": "Self Quantifier",
       "userId": 5
     }
   ]
   },
   {
   "id": 6,
   "email": "toru@prisma.io",
   "name": "Toru Takemitsu",
   "profiles": [
     {
       "id": 16,
       "bio": "Composer",
       "userId": 6
     },
     {
       "id": 17,
       "bio": "Musician",
       "userId": 6
     },
     {
       "id": 18,
       "bio": "Writer",
       "userId": 6
     }
   ]
   }
   ]
   ```

4. Click **Load posts**.

   This returns the following output:

   ```code no-copy
   [
   {
   "id": 11,
   "content": "https://www.prisma.io/blog/comparison-of-database-models-1iz9u29nwn37/",

   "content": "",
   "title": "Music of Tree",
   "authorId": 6,
   "author": {

   }
   },
   {
   "id": 15,
   "content": "",
   "title": "Waves for clarinet, horn, two trombones and bass drum ",
   "authorId": 6,
   "author": {
     "id": 6,
     "email": "toru@prisma.io",
     "name": "Toru Takemitsu"
   }
   }
   ]
   ```

   <Admonition type="info">

   This API call uses Prisma to get all `posts` in the database with their related `authors`. The code is in the `pages/api/posts.js` file.

   </Admonition>

### Result

You have now tested the API for your application and added data to your database.

## Summary

You have successfully deployed your application and database to Kinsta.

For more insight into the Prisma Client API, look at the function handlers in the [`api/` directory](https://github.com/kinsta/hello-world-prisma/tree/main/pages/api) of the example repository.
